# Learning Rust

This is my journey learning rust, and the projects that I have
made along this journey. To run the files, go into a terminal,
scary, and cd into file directory of desired file.
Afterwords you run:

    python <file>

of course replacing the _"file"_ with the desired file to run.

The Majority of the explaning takes place in the code. I am a
firm believer that code explains its self, with good comments,
and format.

___if you feel that I was sub par is some manner do not hesitate to
fix it___

# Section One

<!-- Summery of Section One -->
Get real comfortable with a search engine of your choice.
I suggest [Brave Search](https://search.brave.com/) and
[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), in my opinion brave has better results.
Better learn how to look stuff up now rather than later.
